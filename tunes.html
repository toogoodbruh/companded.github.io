          <h4>Benefits of a Tune</h4>
          <p>Tuning your car has many benefits, from decreased acceleration times to better throttle response and improved fuel economy.  Some tunes for these cars have options like 2-step and no-lift shift.  2-step is a second rev limiter for building boost when launching the car.  A no-lift shift is when you keep your foot to the floor when changing gears in a manual car.  Both are known for loud "bangs" and even flames. On the 150 hp and 180 hp versions of the 1.8t, you can expect around 200 hp and 230 ft. lb. of toque from a stage 1 tune and about 250 hp close to 300 ft. lb. of torque for the 225 hp Audi TT.  The stage 2 tunes yield 230 hp and 280 fl. lb. of torque for the 150/180 hp cars and 275 hp and 320 ft. lb. of torque for the 225 hp Audi TT.</p>

          <h4>"Stages"</h4>
          <p>People in the VW world will almost always refer to their modifications as stages. Stage 1 is just an ECU tune with an intake. Stage 2 is just adding a downpipe (often catless) and a diverter valve to account for the higher boost pressure from the tune. Stage 3 is typically a custom tune for a car with an upgraded turbo, intercooler, downpipe, etc.</p>

          <h4>How to tune these cars</h4>
          <p>The most common and easiest way to tune a VW from the last 20 years is with an ECU flash. This is when you change the software running on the car's engine control module with a computer and the car's OBD II port.  Numerous companies offer and off the shelf solution and give an expected power output. There is also software with base tunes that can be adjusted to the owner's desire, though you will need some knowledge of how to write a tune for a car.  The process of reflashing the ECU is the same as it would be for an off-the-shelf tune.</p>

          <h4>Passing Emissions</h4>
          <p>Emissions inspection is an important thing to keep in mind when modifying any car. Most off-the-shelf tunes will be emissions-compliant in all 50 states for the 1.8t, but a custom tune may not pass. For example, cars like mine with a Eurodyne Maestro tune can quickly fail with a stage 2 tune because various emissions systems are turned off by default. With those systems disabled for diagnostics, your car will likely fail an OBD II inspection - my car did twice in New Jersey.  Of course, these options are there for those that remove specific emissions components like the secondary air injection pump, the EVAP system, the EGR system, and most commonly, the catalytic converter.</p>
