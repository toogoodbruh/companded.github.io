        <h3>Buying a MKIV, New Beetle or TT?</h3>
        <p>Here are a few things to look out for.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Water Pump and Timing Belt</h4>
          <p>The most important thing to check when buying one of these cars is the water pump and timing belt.  It's a good idea to ask the seller if both have been replaced and, if so, to see the paperwork.  This maintenance item is supposed to be done every 75,000 miles to ensure proper timing and water circulation in the engine.  If the seller cannot provide proof of the work, it's a safe bet that you'll need to keep about $1,000 extra aside if you buy the car.  A timing belt cover is easily accessible on the left side of the engine.  Move it to the side to inspect the timing belt.  Even if the timing belt appears okay, the water pump might be on its way out.  In the 1.8t of this time, the water pump is a significant weak spot as the car ages.  The impeller is made of plastic, becoming brittle over the years from so many heat cycles.  If you are not experienced with working on cars, go to a trustworthy mechanic.  When dealing with engine timing, it is crucial to get it right, or else severe damage may occur.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Suspension Components</h4>
          <p>Let’s face it, the MKIV and PQ34 platforms are nearly becoming classics.  With cars that have higher mileage, take a good look at the suspension components and bushings.  Worn suspension can lead to worse ride quality and be a potential safety risk.  To add, worn suspension can also cause uneven tire wear the longer the issue is not addressed.  One way to tell is if the car is super floaty when test-driving.  A visual inspection of all the components is easy and worn bushings or leaking shocks are not hard to miss.  Another recommended thing to do before committing to a purchase is to ask to get a pre-purchase inspection done by a trustworthy mechanic.  This will cost about $90 and tell you a lot about how much money you will need to put into the car immediately after buying.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Lights</h4>
          <p>Early on in these cars' lives, there were several recalls on the brake switch for the taillights.  These components were covered under several recalls, so the chances of finding a car with a faulty switch are slim.  It is worth mentioning because a faulty switch can keep the brake lights from activating when pressing the brake pedal.  For any car, not just these VW models, check to ensure all external lights on the vehicle function correctly.  Check to ensure no bulbs are dead and that the turn signals do not double blink - that typically means there’s a dead bulb or a faulty connection. If the turn signals still double-blink and all bulbs are lighting up, disconnect each bulb on the double-blinking side and reconnect it a few times to remove any corrosion on the connectors.  If cleaning the connections does not solve the problem, the blinker switch may be faulty.  My car suffers from this issue.  Just beware that this switch is behind the dashboard on these cars and is not the easiest to reach.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Brakes and Tires</h4>
          <p>Brakes and tires are not something to mess around with.  Worn brakes can be disastrous in the event of a sudden stop, and stuck brakes can contribute to loss of control of the car.  Bald tires or ones with bubbles in the sidewall should be changed immediately.  Hydroplaning and loss of traction are increased risks when running worn tires, and bubbles can pop, which usually cause the driver to lose control of their vehicle.  Worn tires are easy to spot too, and most tires have wear indicators within the tread that can be used as a reference.  If you see the metal wire in the tires, do not drive the car until the tires are changed! That wire keeps the tire together when rotating at high speeds and is not meant to be exposed.  Brakes (pads and rotors) front and back will set you back about $600-$700 at a shop, though this is an easy job for an at-home mechanic and will cost much less.  To do rear pads and rotors on my Beetle was $50 plus another $30 for a caliper compression set.  Tires will vary due to the array of wheel sizes on the MKIV and PQ34.  For Michelin Pilot Sport A/S3+, it was $650 after shop fees, taxes, and an alignment for 225/45/R17 tires.</p>

          <h4>Window Regulators and Door Locks</h4>
          <p>These two items are also important.  Window regulators in this era's Volkswagens are fine overall, except for the clips that hold the window glass in place. Being cheap plastic, they break over time and lead to the window not closing by itself or the glass outright falling in the door and shattering.  Replacing these can be done at home, but ensure you have punches for rivets in the interior door panel.  The door locks also fair over time.  My driver's side one stopped responding to the key fab but still worked with the physical key.  It is the same procedure to replace the window regulator, except there is no need to disassemble it.  Just know that the range with the key fab is not great, maybe about 30 feet max.</p>
