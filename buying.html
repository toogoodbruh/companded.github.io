        <h3>Buying a MKIV, New Beetle or TT?</h3>
        <p>Here are a few things to look out for.</p>

          <h4>Water Pump and Timing Belt</h4>
          <p>Probably the most important thing to check when buying on of these cars is the water pump and timing belt.  It's a good idea to ask the seller if both have been replaced and if so, to see the paperwork.  This is a maintenance item that is supposed to be done every 75,000 miles to ensure proper timing and water circulation in the engine.  If the seller cannot provide proof of the work, it's a safe bet you'll need to keep about $1,000 extra aside if you buy the car.  There is a timing belt cover that is easily accessible on the left side of the engine.  Simply move it to the side to inspect the timing belt.  Even if the timing belt appears to be fine, the water pump might be on its way out.  In the 1.8t of this time, the water pump is a significant weakspot as the car ages.  The impeller is made of plastic which becomes brittle over the years from so many heat cycles.  If you are not experienced with working on cars, go to a trustworthy mechanic.  When dealing with engine timing, it is crucial to get it right or else serious damage may occur.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Suspension Components</h4>
          <p>Lets face it, the MKIV and PQ34 platforms are near becoming classics.  With cars that have higher mileage, take a good look at the suspension components and bushings.  Worn suspension can lead to worse ride quality and be a potential safety risk.  To add, worn suspension can also cause uneven tire wear the longer the issue is not addressed.  One way to tell is if the car is super floaty when test driving.  A visual inspection of all of the components is easy and worn bushings or leaking shocks are not hard to miss.  Another recommended thing to do before committing to a purchase is ask to get a pre-purchase inspection done by a trustworthy mechanic.  This will cost about $90 and will tell you a lot about how much money you will need to put into the car immediately after buying.</p>

          <h4>Lights</h4>
          <p>Early on in these cars' lives, there were several recalls pertaining to the brake switch for the tail lights.  These components were covered under several recalls, so the chances of finding a car with a falty switch are slim.  It still is worth mentioning though, because a faulty switch can keep the brake lights from activating when pressing on the brake pedal.  For any car, not just these VW models, check to make sure all external lights on the vehicle are functioning properly.  Check to make sure no bulbs are dead and that the turn signals do not double blink - that typically means theres a dead bulb or a faulty connection. If the turn signals still double blink and all bulbs are lighting up, disconnect each bulb on the side that is double blinking and reconnect it a few times to wear away any corrosion on the connectors.  If cleaning the connections does not solve the problem, it may be the blinker switch that is faulty.  My personal car sufferes from this issue.  Just beware that this switch is behind the dashboard on these cars and is not the easiest thing to reach.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Brakes and Tires</h4>
          <p>Brakes and tires are not something to mess around with.  Worn brakes can be disastrous in the event of a sudden stop and stuck brakes can contribute to loss of control of the car.  Bald tires or ones with bubbles in the sidewall should be changed as soon as possible.  Hydroplaning and loss of traction are increased risks when running worn tires and bubbles can pop, which usually cause the driver to lose control of their vehicle.  Worn tires are easy to spot too and most tires have wear indicators within the tread that can be used as a reference.  If you see metal wire in the tires, do not drive the car until the tires are changed! That wire is what keeps the tire together when it's rotating at such high speeds and is not meant to be exposed.  Brakes (pads and rotors) front and back will probably set you back about $600-$700 at a shop, though this is an easy job for at-home mechanic and will cost much less.  To do rear pads and rotors on my Beetle, it was $50 plus another $30 for a caliper compression set.  Tires will vary due to the array of wheel sizes on the MKIV and PQ34.  For Michellin Pilot Sport A/S3+, it was $650 after shop fees, taxes and an alignment for 225/45/R17 tires.</p>

          <h4>Window Regulators and Door Locks</h4>
          <p>These two items are also important.  Window regulators in Volkswagens of this era are overall fine, except for the clips that hold the window glass in place. Being that they are cheap plastic, they break over time and lead to the window not closing by itself, or the glass outright falling in the door and shattering.  Replacing these can be done at home, but make sure you have punches for rivots in the interior door panel.  The door locks also fair over time.  My driver's side one stopped responding to the key fab, but still worked with the physical key.  It is the same procedure to replace as the window regulator excecpt that there is no need to disassemble the window regulator.  Just know that the range with the key fab is not great, maybe about 30 feet max.</p>
