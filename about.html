              <h3>Interior</h3>
              <p>My New Beetle has the rarer two-tone leather seats with body colored door panels.  This was an option for the GLS trim and is more common with the GLX.  The Turbo S only had two-tone seats with black and grey leather.  The car has 6 CD changer, another rare option, as well as a cassette player built into the radio.  It also has heated seats and a sunroof.  Overall, it's decent interior and has held up fairly well over the years.</p>

              <h3>Mileage</h3>
              <p>I bought this car in August 2018 with 31,000 miles on it and in June of 2023, reached 61,000 miles.  My ownership experience has been great and I have found the car to be super reliable.  It certainly can take a beating, as I don't go easy on the thing.</p>

              <h3>Short Shifter</h3>
              <p>As referenced on the <a href="https://beetlebuild.toogoodbruh.com/parts#shifter">Modifications</a> page, I put a Diesel Geek short shifter in the car.  I wanted to do this upgrade for a while and finally did when the original shifter weight's threads stripped and wouldn't grip on the transmission.  The driving experience is enhanced and I am able to shift much quicker than with the OEM parts.</p>

              <h3>Tune and Downpipe</h3>
              <p>My time with the <a href="https://beetlebuild.toogoodbruh.com/parts#tune">tune and downpipe</a> has been amazing!  If there was one thing I had to choose of all that's done to my car, it would be the tune.  Even if I'm not enjoying some backroads, I feel the extra power from the tune at all times.  As for the downpipe, it's just hanging underneath my car right now, not hooked up to the rest of the exhaust system.  The car is super loud, but liveable and sounds really cool.  I currently have a custom stage 2 tune I made with the Eurodyne Maestro tuning suite.  The Beetle has 2-step and no-lift shift enabled.  My best time at the drag strip is 14.7 seconds at 95 mph with a bad knock sensor wire (since fixed).  I hope to go racing again soon, as the car does not pull timing anymore and makes peak power again.</p>

              <h3>Coilovers</h3>
              <p>The coilovers were also worth every penny.  The Beetle had terrible body roll, even in a slight turn and the ride quality was harsh.  After getting the <a href="https://beetlebuild.toogoodbruh.com/parts#coils">ECS coilovers</a> installed, the ride quality actually improved slightly and the handling of the car greatly improved.</p>

              <h3>Aftermarket Headlights and Taillights</h3>
              <p>My original headlights were very foggy and the bulbs were super dim.  It was like driving blind at night.  I found these <a href="https://beetlebuild.toogoodbruh.com/parts#lights">lights</a> after doing a lot of research online for modern looking headlights.  They came with super dim low/high beams (it's the same bulb) so I eventually bought LED low beams on Amazon too.  These were a bit of a pain to wire up though, so buyer beware.  The actual headlight portion was plug and play, but the LED daytime running lights, you know, what you bought the things for, have to be wired to your headlight switch.  There is a free pin on the headlight switch, that they can be connected to without causing a short to the car's electrical system.  I also got aftermarket taillights from Ebay that give the car a much more modern look.  They feature sequential turn signals and an LED running light.</p>
