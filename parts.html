              <h3>Coilovers</h3>
              <p>Upgrading your suspension is a great idea!  If you're looking for a better stance, you can go with air suspension or a traditional coilover setup.  If you are looking for better handling, coilovers are the way to go.  They will lower your car's ride height and stiffen it up a bit, significantly reducing body roll.  I went with the <a href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-ecs-parts/ecs-street-coilover-system-with-installation-kit/021544ecs01kt1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">ECS Coilovers</a> because they are a nice balance between price and driving improvements.  After installation at a shop, an alignment and the <a href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-ecs-parts/front-adjustable-sway-bar-end-links/018045ecs01~a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">ECS Adjustable Front Swaybar End Links</a>, the cost was under $1000.</p>

              <h3>Short Shifter</h3>
              <p>Adding a short shifter to your car sharpens up the feeling of changing gears.  A tighter shifter allows for quicker, shorter gear changes as the name would suggest.  Diesel Geek is one manufacturer that is well-known for their quality products and installation guides.  They did not go too agressive with the throw reduction on their short shifters the prevent stretching of the shifter cables (that's an expensive and difficult repair). <a href="https://dieselgeek.com/products/sigma-5-five-speed-short-shift-kit-for-mk4-vw" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">5 speed 02J</a> <a href="https://dieselgeek.com/products/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">6 speed 02M</a></p>

              <h3>Diverter Valve</h3>
              <p>A diverter valve is a great upgrade for your 1.8t, especially if your car is tuned.  They can improve turbo response and make the turbo more audible, paired with an aftermarket intake.  This is highly recommended when tuned because, at least with the <a href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-apr-parts/r1-diverter-valve-priced-each/dv100001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">APR R1</a> diverter valve, you get an upgraded spring that can appropriately handle the increased boost pressure.</p>

              <h3>Intake</h3>
              <p>Aftermarket intakes can help deliver cooler air to the engine with proper heat shielding.  If you are running a cone filter and not the OEM box style, you will definitely hear the turbo and diverter valve a lot more.  You can find them from reputable companies and on Ebay.  I got my intake from Ebay for $35.</p>

              <h3>Aftermarket Headlights</h3>
              <p>Let's face it, these cars are getting up there in age.  Getting aftermarket headligh housings for your MKIV or PQ34 can significantly improve its look.  The Golf and Jetta have the most options, but the Beetle and TT have a few nice ones as well.  The set I got for my car set me back $200 and are made by Sonar.</p>

              <h3>Wheels and Tires</h3>
              <p>Wheels and tires can really improve the look and handling capabilities of your car.  Tires are more important if you are really on a budget, as they are going to be the ones to improve the handling of your car.  The wheel sizes on these cars range from 16" to 18" with varying tire widths.  I personally recommend the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+ as they are the best all-season tire that do not sacrifice traction and snow driving abilities.  I was able to drive in 6" of unplowed snow in a lowered beetle and tear up some back roads in the summer.</p>

              <h3>Brakes</h3>
              <p>The two things you do not cheap out on are tires and brakes.  A good set of brakes, whether its just pads and rotors, or a big brake kit, will give more confidence when driving.  There are even ceramic pads that improve braking abilities while creating very minimal dust.  Having less brake dust keeps your wheels looking cleaner and easier to clean with less potential staining. I did the rear pads and rotors on my Beetle for $50 in my driveway, it's such an easy job.</p>

              <h3>Stage 1 Tune and Downpipe</h3>
              <p>Feel like your car is slow? Want to make your daily more exciting? Get your 1.8t or 1.9 tdi tuned!  I can personally tell you that getting my 1.8t tuned was worth every penny.  There are many tuners out there: APR, Unitronic, Eurodyne, custom tunes, etc.  I went with the <a href="https://www.goapr.com/products/software/ecu_upgrade/gasoline/4/18t_ea113_mpi/parts/ECU-18T-EA113" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefererr">APR Stage 1</a> tune in March 2020.  At the time, they claimed 215 hp and 246 lb. ft. of torque on the 93 octane map.  Because of the EPA crackdown on tuners, the latest revision takes a slight power hit, but is emmissions compliant in all 50 states.  The tune has a much more aggressive torque curve and pulls much harder to the same 7,000 rpm redline.  For the downpipe, there are a few options.  You can go with a 2.5" catless pipe, a 3" catless pipe or a 3" high flow catted pipe, all of which go to the stock exhaust diameter for easy installation.  You could also get a custom pipe made if you choose.  I got my 3" catless stainless steel downpipe from Ebay for $65 and have been enjoying the improved turbo response and much louder exhaust - it's straight piped, baby!  Beware that you will need a tune to delete the catylitic converter, even if you go with a high flow cat, as the car will be reading different values from the rear O2 sensor.</p>

              <h3>Front Mount Intercooler</h3>
              <p>A front mount intercooler is a nice upgrade for your 1.8t.  Cooler air helps make consistent power and is more important with the more boost the car makes.  There are many kits available for the Golf and Jetta, but custom pipe work and a sourced intercooler core are required for the Beetle and TT.  Most bolt-ons are not developed with the Beetle and TT in mind.</p>

              <h3>Limited Slip Differential</h3>
              <p>A limited slip differential on its own will greatly improve the handling capabilities of your car.  They ensure that both wheels get the proper amount of power based on traction levels and keep the car from doing a one wheel peel.  These are a big install job and are convenient to do with a clutch replacement.</p>

              <p>A light weight fly wheel improves the responsiveness of the engine, particularly when rev matching.  This is because it is less rotational mass for the engine to have to spin.  This is best done in conjunction with a clutch.</p>
